intends to orient citizens, educators, educational
policymakers, and civil society organisations in a
non-prescriptive way. It is far from our intention
to influence the personality traits of students and
citizens. Rather, our aim is to establish educational
curricular materials and related resources that will
contribute to higher levels of personal and social
development competences for all citizens, as well as
fostering wellbeing, life satisfaction, self-fulfilment,
and inclusivity, through education. The goal of the
framework is to initiate an agreed upon set
of guidelines for the flexible implementation
of “Personal, Social, and Learning to Learn”
education in Member States’ curricula, and specific
school-based curricula, while respecting the
European subsidiarity principle, under which both
education and lifelong learning fall.

adapted to, or tested in practice. A subsequent
step will be to try the LifeComp framework out in
practice by implementing and evaluating it in a
specific context. Feedback from practitioners and
end-users is expected to continuously help with
amending and refining the framework, both by
virtue of the transversal nature of this input, and of
these contributors’ existing educational experiences
(e.g. socio-emotional education)
