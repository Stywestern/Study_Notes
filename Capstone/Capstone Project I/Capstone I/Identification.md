In the resources section it says:
	Design begins with the identification of the need for a product or service. Ask yourself, what engineering problem needs to be solved? What product or service needs to be developed?"
	

The main motivation for this kind of project is the socio-economic problem of farming. Rural areas have a working population problem and in contrast demand for farming products are increasing. So we ought to automize this process to make it more efficient.

The problem we need to solve (I am assuming) is the swift detection of environmental anomalies that would have adverse effects on our agricultural endeavors.  To this end, we need to develop a device -or system of devices- that are equipped with the necessary software to monitor, sense and report such disturbances.
