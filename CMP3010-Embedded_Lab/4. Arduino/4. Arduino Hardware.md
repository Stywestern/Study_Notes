The power of the Arduino is not its ability to crunch code, but rather its ability to interact with the outside world through its input-output (I/O) pins. The Arduino has 14 digital I/O pins labeled 0 to 13 that can be used to turn motors and lights on and off and read the state of switches.
Each digital pin can sink or source about 40 mA of current. This is more than adequate for interfacing to most devices, but does mean that interface circuits are needed to control devices other than simple LED's. In other words, you cannot run a motor directly using the current available from an Arduino pin, but rather must have the pin drive an interface circuit that in turn drives the motor. A later section of this document shows how to interface to a small motor. 
To interact with the outside world, the program sets digital pins to a high or low value using C code instructions, which corresponds to +5 V or 0 V at the pin. The pin is connected to external interface electronics and then to the device being switched on and off. The sequence of events is shown in this figure.

To determine the state of switches and other sensors, the Arduino is able to read the voltage value applied to its pins as a binary number. The interface circuitry translates the sensor signal into a 0 or +5 V signal applied to the digital I/O pin. Through a program command, the Ardiomp interrogates the state of the pin. If the pin is at 0 V, the program will read it as a 0 or LOW. If it is at +5 V, the program will read it as a 1 or HIGH. If more than +5 V is applied, you may blow out your board, so be careful. The sequence of events to read a pin is shown in this figure.

Interacting with the world has two sides. First, the designer must create electronic interface circuits that allow motors and other devices to be controlled by a low (1-10 mA) current signal that switches between 0 and 5 V, and other circuits that convert sensor readings into a switched 0 or 5 V signal. Second, the designer must write a program using the set of Arduino commands that set and read the I/O pins.
