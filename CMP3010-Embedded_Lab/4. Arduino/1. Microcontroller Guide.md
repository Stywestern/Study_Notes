The Arduino microcontroller is an easy to use yet powerful single board computer that has gained considerable traction in the hobby and professional market. The Arduino is open-source, which means hardware is reasonably priced and development software is free. This guide is for students anywhere who are confronting the Arduino for the first time. 

This guide covers the Arduino Uno board (Sparkfun DEV-09950, $29.95), a good choice for students and educators. With the Arduino board, you can write programs and create interface circuits to read switches and other sensors, and to control motors and lights with very little effort. Many of the pictures and drawings in this guide were taken from the documentation on the Arduino site, the place to turn if you need more information. The Arduino section on the ME 2011 web site, https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/me2011/, covers more on interfacing the Arduino to the real world. This is what the Arduino board looks like:

The Duemilanove board features an Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller operating at 5 V with 2 Kb of RAM, 32 Kb of flash memory for storing programs and 1 Kb of EEPROM for storing parameters. The clock speed is 16 MHz, which translates to about executing about 300,000 lines of C source code per second. The board has 14 digital I/O pins and 6 analog input pins. There is a USB connector for talking to the host computer and a DC power jack for connecting an external 6-20 V power source, for example a 9 V battery, when running a program while not connected to the host computer. Headers are provided for interfacing to the I/O pins using 22 g solid wire or header connectors.

The Arduino programming language is a simplified version of C/C++. If you know C, programming the Arduino will be familiar. If you do not know C, no need to worry as only a few commands are needed to perform useful functions. 
An important feature of the Arduino is that you can create a control program on the host PC, download it to the Arduino and it will run automatically. Remove the USB cable connection to the PC, and the program will still run from the top each time you push the reset button. Remove the battery and put the Arduino board in a closet for six months. When you reconnect the battery, the last program you stored will run. This means that you connect the board to the host PC to develop and debug your program, but once that is done, you no longer need the PC to run the program.
