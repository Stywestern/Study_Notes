The LED exercise shows how the Arduino can control the outside world. Many applications require reading the state of sensors, including switches.  If you have a switch, use the continuity (beeper) function of a digital multi meter (DMM) to understand when the leads are open and when they are connected as the button is pushed. 
For this exercise, the Arduino will read the state of a normally-open push button switch and display the results on the PC using the serial.println() command. You will need a switch, a 10 kohm resistor and some pieces of 22 g hookup wire. If you don't have a switch, substitute two wires and manually connect their free ends to simulate a switch closure. The figure below shows the schematic for the circuit on the left and a realization on the right.

Create and run this Arduino program 
void setup() { 
	Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
void loop() { 
	Serial.println(digitalRead(3)); delay(250); 
}

Open the Serial Monitor window. When the switch is open, you should see a train of 1's on the screen. When closed, the 1's change to 0's. On the hardware side, when the switch is open, no current flows through the resistor. When no current flows through a resistor, there is no voltage drop across the resistor, which means the voltage on each side is the same. In your circuit, when the switch is open, pin 3 is at 5 volts which the computer reads as a 1 state. When the switch is closed, pin 3 is directly connected to ground, which is at 0 volts. The computer reads this as a 0 state. 
Now try this program which is an example of how you can have the computer sit and wait for a sensor to change state. 

void setup() { 
	Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
void loop() { 
	while (digitalRead(3) == HIGH) ; 
		Serial.println("Somebody closed the switch!"); 
	while (digitalRead(3) == LOW) ; 
		Serial.println("The switch is now open!"); 
}
