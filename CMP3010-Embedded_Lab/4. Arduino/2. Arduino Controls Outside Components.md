Connect your Arduino to the computer with the USB cable. You do not need the battery for now. The green PWR LED will light. If there was already a program burned into the Arduino, it will run. 
Start the Arduino development environment. In Arduino-speak, programs are called “sketches”, but here we will just call them programs. 
In the editing window that comes up, enter the following program, paying attention to where semi-colons appear at the end of command lines. 

void setup() { 
     Serial.begin(9600); 
     Serial.println("Hello World"); 
 } 
void loop() {

} 

Light emitting diodes (LED's) are handy for checking out what the Arduino can do.. For this task, you need an LED, a 330 ohm resistor, and some short pieces of 22 or 24 g wire. The figure to the right is a sketch of an LED and its symbol used in electronic schematics.
Using 22 g solid wire, connect the 5V power pin on the Arduino to the bottom red power bus on the breadboard and the Gnd pin on the Arduino to the bottom blue power buss on the breadboard. Connect the notched or flat side of the LED (the notch or flat is on the rim that surrounds the LED base; look carefully because it can be hard to find) to the Gnd bus and the other side to a free hole in main area of the breadboard Place the resistor so that one end is in the same column as the LED and the other end is in a free column. From that column, connect a wire to digital pin 2 on the Arduino board. Your setup will look something like this:

To test whether the LED works, temporarily disconnect the wire from pin 2 on the Arduino board and touch to the 5V power bus. The LED should light up. If not, try changing the orientation of the LED. Place the wire back in pin 2. On the LED, current runs from the anode (+) to the cathode (-) which is marked by the notch. The circuit you just wired up is represented in schematic form in the figure below:
![[Pasted image 20250325155313.png]]
Create and run this Arduino program:
	void setup() // one-time actions 
	{ 
		pinMode(2, OUTPUT); // define pin 2 as an output 
	} 
	void loop() // loop forever
	{ 
		digitalWrite(2, HIGH); // pin 2 high (LED on) 
		delay(500); // wait 500 ms 
		digitalWrite(2, LOW); // pin 2 low (LED off) 
		delay(500); // wait 500 ms 
	}

The pinMode command sets the LED pin to be an output. The first digitalWrite command says to set pin 2 of the Arduino to HIGH, or +5 volts. This sends current from the pin, through the resistor, through the LED (which lights it) and to ground. The delay(500) command waits for 500 msec. The second digitalWrite command sets pin 2 to LOW or 0 V stopping the current thereby turning the LED off. Code within the brackets defining the loop() function is repeated forever, which is why the LED blinks. 
This exercise shows how the Arduino can control the outside world. With proper interface circuitry the same code can turn on and off motors, relays, solenoids, electromagnets, pneumatic valves or any other on-off type device.
