Most of the resistors use color-coding for determining values of them. Color coded bands are used to denote the value in a fixed resistor.

The color code is a world-wide standard, and we’ve been using it in electronics for many decades. Although the colors are standardized, a resistor can have either four or five bands of color, depending on whether it’s standard-precision or high-precision. Standard-precision resistors use four color bands. These resistors come within at least 2 percent of their marked value. That is, the markings on the resistor and the actual value of the resistor when you test it fall within at least 2 percent of one another.

Here are some resistor color code examples:
- Red, Red, Orange, Gold: 22 kΩ ±5%
- Brown, Black, Red, Silver: 1 kΩ ±10%
- Orange, Orange, Yellow, Gold: 330 kΩ ±5%
- Yellow, Violet, Brown, Gold: 470 Ω ±5%
- Green, Blue, Red, Silver: 5.6 kΩ ±10%
- Blue, Grey, Black, Gold: 68 Ω ±5%

The last band of the resistor indicates its tolerance. Tolerance takes into account unavoidable variations in resistor manufacturing. Though a resistor may have a 2,000 ohms marking, for example, its actual value may be slightly higher or lower. You refer to the potential variation in value as tolerance, expressed as a percentage (for example, +5- percent tolerance meansthe resistor value may vary plus or minus 5 percent from the stated value). In most cases, being a little off doesn’t significantly affect the operation of the circuit. Knowing the tolerance of the resistor lets you decide if a resistor is adequate for a particular circuit.Tolerance appears in the last column of Table 1-1. Take a look at the yellow-violet-red- silver resistor example. By looking at Table 1-1, you can see that silver, the last band, denotes +10- percent tolerance. This value means that the resistor can vary in tolerance 10 percent higher or lower than its indicated value. If the resistor has an indicated value of 4.7K with a 10 percent tolerance, the actual value can fall anywhere between 4,230 and 5,170 ohms.
Table up there shows the meaning of the color codes used on the bands so that you can determine the value of the resistor. 
- Assume that the resistor has yellow-violet-red-silver markings. The first two bands indicate the first two digits of the value of the resistor. Referring to the Table, yellow represents 4 and violet stands for 7, so the significant digits of a resistor with a yellow-violet-red-silver band scheme are 47. The third band indicates the multiplier, in this example that band is red, so the value is 100. Multiply 47 by 100, and you get 4700 ohms. You express values over 1000 in K (for kilo, or 1000), so you say that the resistor has a value of 4.7K ohm.
