Ohmâ€™s Law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional to the current i flowing through the resistor. 
- v = i . R 
Here are some of the things you can use resistors for:
- Limiting current to another component.
- Reducing voltage to part of the circuit.
- Controlling the voltage/current going into another component.
- Protecting the inputs of sensitive components.

Two or more elements are in series if they are cascaded or connected sequentially and consequently carry the same current.
Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them
