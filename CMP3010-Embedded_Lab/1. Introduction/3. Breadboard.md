A solderless breadboard, like the basic model in Figure below, consists of a series of square holes, and inside the holes are rows and rows of metal strips. The metal strips, which are made of a flexible material, have been bent to make a channel. You slide wire into the holes and securely connect it inside the metal channel. 
You call the metal channels inside the breadboard contacts. Each column in each row connects electrically. Each column connects together five holes, all also electrically joined. With this setup, you can connect components and wires just by plugging them into the right holes on the board. 
Note also the long rows of contacts at the very top and bottom of the solderless breadboard. These rows help you make convenient connections to power and ground. Most boards have two rows at the top and bottom. In some boards, the two rows connect electrically, but on others, each row is electrically isolated from the other. Don’t assume! Use your multimeter to check by sticking a jumper wire in each hole and then touching one probe to one wire and another probe to the other wire. If you get a low ohm reading, the two rows are connected together. If you get an infinite ohms reading, they’re not connected.
