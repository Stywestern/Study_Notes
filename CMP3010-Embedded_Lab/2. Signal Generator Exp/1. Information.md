### Signal Generators 
A signal generator is an electronic instrument that generates repeating voltage waveforms. An ideal signal generator can be simply modelled as a voltage source as shown in figures below, where Vs(t) is a specified function of time. A practical signal generator is modelled as an ideal signal generator connected to a series source resistance (output resistance) s R as shown in figure below. The terminal voltage, v(t), is the output of the signal generator and depends on the terminal current, i(t), and Rs. A sine wave oscillator is the heart of the generator. It generates a sine wave of fixed amplitude and adjustable frequency, which is set by the external frequency control, by attenuator. The output of attenuator I is a sine wave with desired amplitude and frequency:
