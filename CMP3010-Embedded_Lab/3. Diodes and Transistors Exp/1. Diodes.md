Most multimeters can be used to determine the operating condition of a diode. They have scale denoted by a diode symbol that will indicate the condition of a diode in the forward- and reverse-bias regions. If connected to establish a forward-bias condition, the meter will display the forward voltage (offset voltage) across the diode in at a current level typically in the neighborhood of 2 mA. If connected to establish a reverse-bias condition, an “OL” should appear on the display to support the open-circuit approximation frequently applied to this region. If the meter does not have diode-checking capability, the condition of the diode can also be checked by obtaining some measure of the resistance level in the forward- and reverse-bias regions. Both techniques for checking a diode will be introduced in the first part of the experiment. 
The current- volt characteristics of a silicon or germanium diode have the general shape shown in Figure below. Note the change in scale for both the vertical and horizontal axes. In the reverse-biased region the current increases quite rapidly with increasing diode voltage. Note that the curves are rising almost vertically at a forward-biased voltage of less than 1 V. the forward-biased diode current will be limited solely by the network in which the diode is connected or by the maximum current or power rating of the diode. 
The DC or static resistance of a diode at any point an the characteristics is determined by the ratio of the diode voltage at that point, divided by the diode current. 
- That is, RDC = V_D / I_D ohms

### Diode Testing Scale 
The diode-testing scale of a DMM can be used to determine the operating condition of a diode. With one polarity, the DMM should provide “offset voltage” of the diode, while the reverse connection should result is an “OL” response to support the open-circuit approximation. Using the connections shown in figure below, the constant-current source of about 2 mA internal to the meter will forward bias the junction, and a voltage about 0.7 V (700mV) will be obtained for silicon and 0.3 V (300mV) for germanium. If the leads are reserved, an OL indication will be obtained. If a low reading (less than 1 V) is obtained in both directions, the junction is shorted. If an OL indication is obtained in both direction, junction is open.

### LED and Zener 
The light-emitting diode (LED) (fig.3.3) is a diode that will give off visible light when threshold voltage is given. In LED material gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) or gallium phosphide(GaP) used to create light, which is called electroluminescence. For every LED there is a distinct forward voltage and current that will give bright, clear light.
The Zener diode is a p-n junction device designed to take full advantage of the Zener breakdown region. Once the reverse-bias potential reaches the Zener region, the ideal Zener diode is assumed to have fixed terminal voltage and zero internal resistance. All practical diodes some internal resistance which is limited to 5 to 20 Ω. The experimental procedure will show the variation in terminal voltage for different loads and currents. The following procedures are used to determine the state of Zener diode. For most configurations, the state of Zener can be determined by replacing it with an open circuit. If the open-circuit voltage equal or exceeds Zener potential, Zener diode is “on” and Zener diode can replace with a DC power supply.
