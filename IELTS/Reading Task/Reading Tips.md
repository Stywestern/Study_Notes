1. You don't need to read attentively every word. Remember, you just need to answer the questions, nothing more. So skim over the text and then start looking for the answers.
2. Look thoroughly through the text. Any special features such as capital letters, underlining, italics, figures, graphs and tables are likely to matter.
3. Answer all the questions, even if youâ€™re not sure in your answer. You don't get penalty for wrong answers, so try your luck and write the most probable answer.
