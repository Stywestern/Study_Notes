Let's start with the chart in question

#### Overview
In this part, you need to write a general overview that shows the main trends, like biggest and smallest parts or similarities in the first and second charts. Example:

*Overall, equal quantities of both sexes enjoyed listening to music, but a dramatically larger number of girls liked reading. There were also many differences in terms of the children's preferred sports.*

Notes: Always start with the word "overall" to indicate the start. Never write numbers, percentages etc., it should be general information.

#### Body 1 
Depending on the chart, you can either:
- Describe first chart
- Describe increasing or decreasing parts

Generally, if the chart includes 2-3 different groups of stuff go with the first approach, if it includes periods -like 2000 and 2016- and only contains the differences in one group go with second approach. Example:

*Turning to the first chart, we can observe that boys prefer playing computer games (34% participation rate) than taking other activities. Playing basketball comes as the second most popular leisure, practiced by almost a third of male children. Basketball is followed by soccer, which is exercised by 17%. Skateboarding and listening to music are less preferable activities, chosen by 11% and 10% of boys respectively. Reading, the least popular cultural activity among boys, represents only two percent.*

#### Body 2
Continue the explanations depending on the Body 1

*Taking a closer look at the second chart, we can see that girls' most preferred activity is dancing, being 27% of the total. In contrast to the boys' preferences, reading is chosen by more than a fifth of all girls. Although percentage of female children who play computer games is roughly twice less than that of boys (16%), this activity is third most popular on the girls' chart. With a slight difference between computer games and netball, the latter is practiced at 15% rate. Similarly to skateboarding popularity among boys, 11% of girls go in for gymnastics. Listening to music comes as the least popular leisure, with a proportion of 10%, equal to those on the first chart.*

### Final Answer Including Introduction

*The two pie charts draw the conclusion of a survey of boys' and girls' cultural and leisure activities.*

*Overall, equal quantities of both sexes enjoyed listening to music, but a dramatically larger number of girls liked reading. There were also many differences in terms of the children's preferred sports.*
