All writing task 1 questions will have a card likes this, and for introductory section you should be able to paraphrase it well.

You should start your task 1 answer by introducing the graph from your question. Just write 1-2 sentences to say **what your graph shows and for what period of time** (if there is one).

To do this, you need to paraphrase text from your task 1 question.  

**Example of good introduction**:

**Question**:  
The graphs below give information about computer ownership as a percentage of the population between 2002 and 2010, and by level of education for the years 2002 and 2010.

**Introduction**:  
The bar charts show data about computer ownership, with a further classification by level of education, from 2002 to 2010.

After this there will be the body where you again give an overview and explain the features of the graph:
