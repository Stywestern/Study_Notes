*Overall, farmland and houses disappeared from the map, playground was abridged, and there were built science block, car park and sports field.*

Notes: Always start with the word "overall" to indicate the start. Never write numbers, percentages etc., it should be general information.

#### Body 1 
You should generally divide diagrams in smaller parts with a theme that binds the smaller groups -like stages maybe- and then explain the process as it is illustrated on the diagram.

Moreover, substantial changes happened to the houses. They were removed from the map, car park and science block taking their place.*

#### Body 2
Continue the explanations depending on the Body 1
