#### Overview
In this part, you need to write a general overview that shows the main trends, like the biggest and smallest parts or changes in the chart. Example:

*Overall, the peak of visitors' number was in 2012, while the lowest point was in 2009 and 2010.*

Notes: Always start with the word "overall" to indicate the start. Never write numbers, percentages etc., it should be general information.

#### Body 1 
Depending on the chart, you can either:
- Describe the differences between the groups
- Describe increasing or decreasing parts

Generally, if the chart includes 2-3 different groups of stuff go with the first approach, if it includes periods -like 2000 and 2016- and only contains the differences in one group go with second approach. Example:

*Victoria and Albert Museum was the most popular from 2007 to 2009. During 2007-2008 its annual number of visitors remained constant at about 14 million people per year. However, the figure started to decline rapidly in 2009, and reached its lowest point of about 8 millions in 2010, becoming the least popular museum for the rest of the period. After that, the number of Victoria and Albert Museum's visitors gradually rose up to 10 million visitors within 2 years.*

#### Body 2

*British Museum was the second most popular in 2007, being outraced by Victoria and Albert Museum. Nevertheless, its number of visitors experienced a sharp fall in 2008 and remained unchanged the following year. Then, the figure started to increase. It reached its peak of approximately 14 million visitors in 2012, regaining its position of 2007.*

#### Body 3

*National Gallery Museum showed the most notable development with a steady growth throughout the period. Being the least popular museum in the beginning, it experienced a growth of more than 10 million visitors over 6-year period, and became the most visited museum in 2012.*
