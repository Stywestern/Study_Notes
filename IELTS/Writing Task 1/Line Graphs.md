Let's start with the diagram in question

#### Overview
In this part, briefly summarize what happens on the line graph. Example:

*Overall, spending on residential phone services dramatically declined, while popularity of mobile services increased sharply throughout a decade. Also, both of services met at the same record in 2006.*

Notes: Always start with the word "overall" to indicate the start. Never write numbers, percentages etc., it should be general information.

#### Body 1 
Line graphs are similar to bar charts, with the tricky part being finding enough stuff to write about. Apart from the obvious trends -like rising or falling- try to explain the smaller ones, like where did it rise sharply or when did it overtake the other or what is the correlation etc.

*In 2001, spending on mobile phone services began by merely $200, while the amount of annual expenditure on the residential phone services was around $700. Over the following five years, expenditure on landline phone services gradually dropped below $600, whereas expenditure on cell phone services rose to just over $500.*
#### Body 2
Continue the explanations depending on the Body 1

*In 2006 cell phones overtook landline phones, and the services became equal in popularity with customers' annual expenditure of about $550. Then, cell phone expenses rose to approximately $750 in 2010, making nearly a fourfold jump relatively to its initial figure in 2001. Meanwhile, spending on residential phone services experienced a steep fall in 2007 and went on to steadily decrease for the rest of the period.*
