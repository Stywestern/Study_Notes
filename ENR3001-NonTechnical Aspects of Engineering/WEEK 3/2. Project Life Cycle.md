### What is Project Scope? 
- Explanation of the end results of the Project. 
- Clear definition of the deliverables of the Project. 
- Foundation of the Project Plan. SMART. 
- Poorly defined scope greatly impacts the project success:
	- Directly affects cost and schedule.
	- Creates planning problems. 
- Scope documentation maintains the focus on the actual purpose of the Project throughout the life cycle. Project Scope Checklist:
	-  **Project Objective:**
	    - This is the overarching goal or purpose of the project. It answers the question, "Why are we doing this project?"
	    - It should be clear, concise, and measurable.
	    - Example: "To develop a mobile application that increases customer engagement by 20% within six months."
	    
	- **Deliverables:**
	    - These are the tangible or intangible outputs of the project.
	    - They are the specific products, services, or results that will be delivered.
	    - Examples: A software application, a marketing campaign, a completed report, or a construction of a bridge.
	    
	- **Milestones:**
	    - These are significant points or events in the project timeline.
	    - They mark the completion of major phases or deliverables.
	    - They help track progress and ensure that the project is on schedule.
	    - Examples: "Completion of design phase," "Release of beta version," "Final product launch."
	    
	- **Technical Requirements:**
	    - These are the specific technical specifications and standards that the project must meet.
	    - They define the functional and non-functional requirements of the deliverables.
	    - Examples: "The software must be compatible with iOS and Android," "The website must load in under 3 seconds," "The bridge must withstand a certain weight load."
	    
	- **Limits and Exclusions:**
	    - This is a crucial part of the scope. It explicitly states what is _not_ included in the project.
	    - This helps manage expectations and prevent scope creep.
	    - Examples: "This project does not include ongoing maintenance of the software," "This project does not include marketing the new product," "This project does not include landscaping around the building."
	    
	- **Review with Customer:**
	    - This step emphasizes the importance of getting customer or stakeholder buy-in.
	    - The scope document should be reviewed and approved by the customer to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations.
	    - This helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

### Work Breakdown Structure 
Hierarchical division of work into smaller elements is called the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- Map of the Project.
- Integration of the Project with the organization.
- Establishes a basis of control.

### Work Packages 
A work package is the lowest level of the WBS. It is output-oriented in that it:
- Defines work (what).
- Identifies time to complete a work package (how long
- Identifies a time-phased budget to complete a work package (cost)
- Identifies resources needed to complete a work package (how much)
- Identifies a single person responsible for units of work (who)
- Identifies monitoring points (milestones) for measuring success. 
### Scheduling 
A schedule is the conversion of work into a timeline. Advantages of scheduling:
- Visualization
- Evaluation of alternatives
- Assessment of required resources
- Allocation of resources to achieve goals 
Some common scheduling techniques:
