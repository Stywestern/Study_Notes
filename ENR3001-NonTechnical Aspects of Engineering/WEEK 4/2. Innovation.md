### Types of Innovation: Product versus Process Innovation 
The radicalness of an innovation is the degree to which it is new and different from previously existing products and processes. 
Incremental innovations may involve only a minor change from (or adjustment to) existing practices. 
The radicalness of an innovation is relative; it may change over time or with respect to different observers. 
- E.g., digital photography a more radical innovation for Kodak than for Sony.

### Types of Innovation: Competence-Enhancing versus Competence Destroying Innovation 
Competence-enhancing innovations build on the firm’s existing knowledge base 
- E.g., Intel’s Pentium 4 built on the technology for Pentium III. 
Competence-destroying innovations renders a firm’s existing competencies obsolete. 
- E.g., electronic calculators rendered Keuffel & Esser’s slide rule expertise obsolete. 
Whether an innovation is competence enhancing or competence destroying depends on the perspective of a particular firm.

There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to being a first mover, early follower or late entrant. These categories are defined as follows:
- First movers are the first entrants to sell in a new product or service category (pioneers) 
- Early followers (leaders) are early to market but not first. 
- Late entrants do not enter the market until the product begins to penetrate the mass market or later.

### First-Mover Advantages and Disadvantages First-Mover Advantages and Disadvantages 
Being a first mover can confer the advantages of: 
- Brand loyalty and technological leadership 
- Preemption of scarce assets 
- Exploiting buyer switching costs 
- Reaping increasing returns advantages. 
However, first movers often bear disadvantages also: 
- High research and development expenses 
- Undeveloped supply and distribution channels 
- Immature enabling technologies and complements 
- Uncertainty of customer requirements
