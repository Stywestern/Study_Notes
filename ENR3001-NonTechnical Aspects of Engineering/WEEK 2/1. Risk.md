Harm is a physical or psychological or emotional damage or injury to a person, animal or other legal entity. It is generally believed that humans, in addition to other sentient animal species, possess an aversion to causing harm to others. Many religions consider any harm to another person a sin.

Risk = Probability of harm x severity of the harm
	i.e. the risk is higher for hazards that are more likely, and/or more harmful.

Risk can be difficult to calculate, it can also be subjective in practice. An engineer should minimize both risk and the perception of a risk. 
	For example, a chemical in a water supply might be chemically harmless, but if it gives a bad taste then people may perceived it to be harmful. This perception of harm is also harmful.


Perception of risk depends on many factors:
- Involuntary risk: A person taking on a risk voluntarily may consider it to be reasonably safe, but would perceive it to be less safe if forced to take on the same risk. In this case the lack of choice would make the person feel that the harm is greater or more likely to occur (or both). 
- Long-term consequences: A person might consider a hazard that would cause a short-term harm to be safer than one that causes a long-term harm. Here the cost of the harm is considered rather than the probability. 
- Low probability: A person might consider a very low probability hazard to be safe even if the harm was very great (e.g. death). Here the probability of the harm is considered instead of the cost. e.g. A very large meteor impact on the Earth. 
- Risk denial: If there seems little one can do (or want to do) to avoid a risk, then there is a tendency for the risk to be ignored. The risk is replaced with an artificial perception of safety. 
	- Examples: 
		- Smoking: a person ignores the risks because they donâ€™t want to stop smoking. 
		- Global warming: corporations prefer to deny the fact of global warming because acceptance will be costly to business. 
		- Large meteor impact: world powers might ignore this risk of a meteor impact because the solution would be a very expensive deep space program. 
- Delayed affect: A harm that would be delayed for many years may be perceived as safer than one that has an immediate affect. People tend to discount the risk of such hazards. e.g. Climate change, Smoking, unhealthy eating.
