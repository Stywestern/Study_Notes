### Global warming
As well as many other activities that are damaging to the environment, a major environmental concern is that of global warming which is believed to be caused mainly by increase of CO2 (a green-house gas) from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas).

### Environmental ethics
Environmental ethics is the part of environmental philosophy which considers extending the traditional boundaries of ethics to include the non-human world. 
So far we have focused on the responsibility of engineers to ensure the safety and well-being of the public. The interest here has always been people. Now we will consider what responsibilities we have to protect the environment, including animals, ecosystems, and the biosphere in general. We will look at different points of view that exist, and the trends in modern environmental ethics. As well as our local environment, we are also talking about “Ecosystems” and the “Biosphere”.
An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals and microbes) in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. 
The biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems - the zone of life on Earth.

We will see that there are two key arguments in favor of protecting the environment: 
1. Taking care of ecosystems benefits society and can even be key to our existence. 
2. Other sentients (e.g. animals) also have rights.
