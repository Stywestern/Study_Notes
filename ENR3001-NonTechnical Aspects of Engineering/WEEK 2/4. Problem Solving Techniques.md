### Flow-charting decision making
In engineering, the decision-process can be aided by overviewing the options that are available to us, and consequences of each decision.
Such an overview can be illustrated in the form of a flow chart.

### The Reliability Block Diagram 
A reliability block diagram (RBD) is a diagrammatic method for showing how component reliability contributes to the success or failure of a complex system.
An RBD is drawn as a series of blocks connected in parallel or series. 
Each block represents a component. Parallel paths are redundant, meaning that all of the parallel paths must fail for the parallel network to fail. By contrast, any failure along a series path causes the entire series path to fail.

### Hypothetical line drawing 
Another technique that we can use to help solve an ethical problem is that of hypothetical line drawing. In this technique a number of hypothetical cases are placed on a line which is a measure of how positive or negative the concept is. 
This provides us with two useful results: 
1. A measure of how positive or negative a current case is. 
2. Alternative solutions that could provide a better outcome.

Example: Currently a microwave transmitter is legal at 0.2 x exposure limit. Possible modifications can be considered: 
1. The transmitter can increase power to 0.5 x legal exposure limit. 
2. A better receiver antenna can be used which will allow power to be reduced by 30%. 
3. Improved electronics and protocols can be used that will allow the power to be reduced by 50%. 
4. Both (2) and (3) will result in power reduction by 60%. 
5. Implement an alternative data transmission system not based on microwaves
