A Professional Engineer has the responsibility to place public safety and interest above all other considerations. 
However, the engineer also has a responsibility to act in the best interests of the employer. This includes, for example, making decisions that maximize the profitability of the corporation, keeping proprietary information (information owned by the company) confidential, and so on.
Pressures from your employer or supervisor, or from your own desire to perform, can lead to ethical conflicts.

Common Ethical Violations 
	• Failing to protect the public 
	• Unethical disclosure of facts & information
	• Failure to include all pertinent information in professional reports. 
	• Circumventing laws (e.g. VW emissions scandal) 
	• Performing work for which one is not qualified 
	• Expressing professional opinion not founded upon adequate facts and technical competence

The responsibility of engineers to ensure the safety and well-being of the public can sometimes place the engineer in conflict with other engineers or management within an organisation. However, the most fundamental right of an engineer is the right of professional conscience. 
This includes the right to exercise professional judgment in an ethical manner, and the right to refuse to engage in unethical behavior when pressured to do so by the employer. 

Example: An employer or supervisor asks an engineer to ignore or falsify results of safety tests or try to cut costs resulting in an unsafe product. 
It is the legal and ethical right of the engineer to be able to speak out in such a situation without fear of dismissal. The engineer would be supported in a court of law.

Although it may be perceived to be disloyal, an engineer may need to expose unethical practices within their company - this is called whistle-blowing...
A whistle-blower is a person who exposes misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization.

Whistle-blowing may be attempted only when the following three conditions are met: 
1. Need There must be a clear harm that can be avoided. 
2. Proximity You must be in a good position to report the problem. That is you must have first-hand knowledge of the problem and expertise to understand it. 
3. Last resort You may whistle-blow if there is no one else in better proximity to the problem, and you have tried all other channels to solve the problem.
