The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a model for a computer protocol architecture and as a framework for developing protocol standards. The OSI model consists of seven layers: 
	• Application 
	• Presentation 
	• Session 
	• Transport 
	• Network 
	• Data link 
	• Physical

The designers of OSI assumed that this model and the protocols developed within this model would come to dominate computer communications, eventually replacing proprietary protocol implementations and rival multivendor models such as TCP/IP. This has not happened. Instead, the TCP/IP architecture has come to dominate. There are a number of reasons for this outcome: 
1. TCP/IP protocols were mature and well tested at a time when similar OSI protocols were in the development stage. 
2. When businesses began to recognize the need for interoperability across networks, only TCP/IP was available and ready to go. 
3. Another reason is that the OSI model is unnecessarily complex, with seven layers to accomplish what TCP/IP does with fewer layers.

Because the functions of each layer are well defined in OSI, standards can be developed independently and simultaneously for each layer. This speeds up the standards-making process. 
Because the boundaries between layers are well defined, changes in standards in one layer need not affect already existing software in another layer. This makes it easier to introduce new standards. 
The overall function is broken up into a number of modules, making the interfaces between modules as simple as possible. The design principle of information hiding is used: Lower layers are concerned with greater levels of detail; upper layers are independent of these details. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer and implements a protocol to the peer layer in other systems. 
The services between adjacent layers in the OSI architecture are expressed in terms of primitives and parameters. A primitive specifies the function to be performed, and the parameters are used to pass data and control information. The actual form of a primitive is implementation dependent. An example is a procedure call. 
Four types of primitives are used in standards to define the interaction between adjacent layers in the architecture:
- Request: A primitive issued by the a service user to invoke some service and to pass the parameters needed to specify fully the requested service
- Indication: A primitive issued by a service provider either to
	- Indicate that a procedure has been invoked by the peer service user on the connection and to provide the associated parameters
	- Notify service user of a provider-initiated action
- Response: A primitive issued by a service user to acknowledge or complete some procedure previously invoked by an indication to that user.
- Confirm: A primitive issued by a service provider to acknowledge or complete some procedure previously invoked by a request by the service user

Example: Consider the transfer of data from an (N) entity to a peer (N) entity in another system. The following steps occur: 
1. The source (N) entity invokes its (N – 1) entity with a request primitive. Associated with the primitive are the parameters needed, such as the data to be transmitted and the destination address. 
2. The source (N – 1) entity prepares an (N – 1) PDU to be sent to its peer (N – 1) entity. 
3. The destination (N– 1) entity delivers the data to the appropriate destination (N) entity via an indication primitive, which includes the data and source address as parameters. 
4. If an acknowledgment is called for, the destination (N) entity issues a response primitive to its (N – 1) entity. 
5. The (N – 1) entity conveys the acknowledgment in an (N – 1) PDU. 6. The acknowledgment is delivered to the (N) entity as a confirm primitive.
