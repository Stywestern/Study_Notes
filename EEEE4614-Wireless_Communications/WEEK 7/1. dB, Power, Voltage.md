- **dB for Power and Voltage:**
    - **"Power 10log"**: Power ratios are expressed in dB using a factor of 10.
    - **"Voltage 20log"**: Voltage ratios are expressed in dB using a factor of 20.
    - **"X(dB) = 10 log<sub>10</sub> (X<sub>linear scale</sub>)"**: This is the general formula to convert a linear power ratio to dB.
    - **"dB scale"**: Emphasizes that dB is a logarithmic scale.
    
- **Reference Values:**
    - **"Power: 10log P / P<sub>reference</sub>"**: This is the general formula to calculate power in dB relative to a reference power.
    - **"could be 1W -> dBW"**: When the reference power is 1 watt (W), the unit is called dBW.
    - **"could be 1mW -> dBm"**: When the reference power is 1 milliwatt (mW), the unit is called dBm.
    
- **Example Calculation:**
    - **"ex 20dBm = 100 x 1mW = 100mW"**: This illustrates how to convert dBm to mW.
    - **"10 log<sub>10</sub> P = 20"**: This sets up the equation to solve for the power P.
    - **"log<sub>10</sub> P = 2"**: Dividing both sides by 10.
    - **"P = 10<sup>2</sup> = 100mW"**: Solving for P.
    
- **Logarithmic Property:**
    - **"10log(ab) = 10log a + 10log b"**: This reminds us of the logarithmic property used in dB calculations.
- **Linear Power (W) vs. dBW Conversion Table:**
    - The table shows corresponding values of power in watts (W) and dBW.
    - **40W = 16 dBW**
    - **8W = 9 dBW**
    - **2W = 3 dBW**
    - **1W = 0 dBW** (This is the reference point)
    - **0.125W = -9 dBW**
    - **0.001W = -30 dBW**
    
- **Relationship between dBW and dBm:**
    - **"n dBW = (n + 30) dBm"**: This shows the direct conversion between dBW and dBm. Since 1W = 1000mW = 10<sup>3</sup> mW, there is a 30 dB difference (10 log<sub>10</sub> 1000 = 30).
    - **"dBW = 10 log<sub>10</sub> n Watt = 10 log<sub>10</sub> n 10<sup>3</sup> mW = 10 log<sub>10</sub> n + 10 log<sub>10</sub> 10<sup>3</sup> mW"**: This breaks down the derivation of the conversion formula.
