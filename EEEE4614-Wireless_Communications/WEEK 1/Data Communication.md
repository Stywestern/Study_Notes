It is often impractical for two communicating devices to be directly, point to point connected. Because; 
1. The devices are very far apart. It would be too expensive to have a dedicated link between these two devices. 
2. There is a set of devices, each of which may require a link to many of the others at various times. 

The solution to this problem is to attach each device to a communication network. There are two major categories: LAN and WLAN 
- Local Area Networks (LANs) 
	- Short distances  
	- Designed to provide local interconnectivity 
- Wide Area Networks (WANs)  
	- Long distances 
	- Provide connectivity over large areas
- Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
	- Provide connectivity over areas such as a city, a campus 

The Internet
- Internet evolved from ARPANET 
- first operational packet network 
- applied to tactical radio & satellite nets also 
- had a need for interoperability 
- led to standardized TCP/IP protocols
