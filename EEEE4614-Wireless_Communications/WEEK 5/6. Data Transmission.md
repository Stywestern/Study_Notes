**1. Analog Transmission:**
- **Content-Agnostic:**
    - Analog signals are transmitted without regard to the content of the data they carry.
    - Whether the data is analog (like voice) or digital (like data from a modem), the transmission process remains the same.
- **Attenuation:**
    - Analog signals weaken (attenuate) as they travel over distance.
- **Amplification:**
    - Amplifiers are used to boost the signal strength.
    - However, amplifiers also amplify any noise present in the signal, degrading the signal quality.

**2. Digital Transmission:**
- **Content-Aware:**
    - Digital transmission is concerned with the content of the data (the bit patterns).
- **Integrity Issues:**
    - Noise, attenuation, and other impairments can corrupt the integrity of digital signals, leading to bit errors.
- **Repeaters:**
    - Repeaters are used to overcome these issues.
    - A repeater receives the weakened digital signal, extracts the original bit pattern, and retransmits a clean, strong signal.
    - This effectively eliminates attenuation and prevents the amplification of noise.

**3. Advantages of Digital Transmission:**
- **Digital Technology:**
    - The widespread availability of low-cost LSI/VLSI (Large-Scale Integration/Very Large-Scale Integration) technology makes digital transmission cost-effective.
- **Data Integrity:**
    - Digital transmission allows for reliable data transmission over longer distances and lower-quality lines due to the use of repeaters and error-correction techniques.
- **Capacity Utilization:**
    - High-bandwidth links have become economically feasible, and digital techniques enable efficient use of this bandwidth through multiplexing.
- **Security & Privacy:**
    - Digital data can be easily encrypted, providing strong security and privacy.
- **Integration:**
    - Digital systems can treat both analog and digital data similarly, allowing for seamless integration of various types of communication.

**4. Transmission Impairments:**
- **Signal Degradation:**
    - The signal received may differ from the signal transmitted due to various impairments.
    - In analog transmission, this results in a degradation of signal quality.
    - In digital transmission, this results in bit errors.
- **Causes:**
    - **Attenuation and Attenuation Distortion:**
        - Attenuation is the weakening of signal strength.
        - Attenuation distortion occurs when different frequency components of a signal are attenuated differently.
    - **Delay Distortion:**
        - Different frequency components of a signal travel at different speeds through the transmission medium, causing delays.
    - **Noise:**
        - Noise is unwanted signals that interfere with the transmitted signal.
