- Sine waves are fundamental building blocks of signals.
- Frequency, amplitude, and phase are key parameters that characterize sine waves.
- Wavelength is related to frequency and the velocity of the wave.
- Fourier analysis allows us to understand the frequency content of complex signals.
- The frequency domain is an alternative to the time domain, and both are useful views of a signal.


**1. Sine Wave:**
- A sine wave is a fundamental waveform in signal processing and physics. It represents a smooth, periodic oscillation.
- The general equation for a sine wave is: s(t) = A sin(2πft + Φ)

**2. Peak Amplitude (A):**
- The maximum strength or height of the sine wave.
- It represents the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position.
- Measured in volts (V) for electrical signals or other appropriate units.
- In sound waves, it relates to the loudness of the sound.

**3. Frequency (f):**
- The rate at which the sine wave repeats itself per second.
- Measured in Hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second.
- Period (T): The time it takes for one complete cycle of the sine wave.
    - Relationship: T = 1/f

**4. Phase (Φ):**
- The relative position of the sine wave in time.
- It indicates the starting point of the wave cycle at time t = 0.
- Measured in degrees or radians.
- A phase shift can cause a time delay in the signal.

**5. Wavelength (λ):**
- The distance occupied by one complete cycle of the sine wave.
- Or, the distance between two corresponding points in consecutive cycles.
- Relationship to frequency and velocity:
    - λ = vT (where v is the velocity of the wave)
    - λf = v
    - For electromagnetic waves in free space, v = c (speed of light, approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).
- Audible sound wave example, and visible light example is given to give some context.

**6. Varying Sine Waves:**
- The equation s(t) = A sin(2πft + Φ) shows how the amplitude (A), frequency (f), and phase (Φ) of a sine wave can vary.

**7. Frequency Domain Concepts:**
- **Signal Composition:**
    - Most signals are not pure sine waves but are composed of multiple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.
    - Fourier Analysis: A mathematical technique that decomposes a complex signal into its constituent sine wave components.
- **Frequency Domain Representation:**
    - Instead of plotting the signal's amplitude as a function of time (time domain), we can plot the amplitude of each frequency component as a function of frequency (frequency domain).
    - This representation provides valuable insights into the signal's frequency content.
    - This is very useful for things like equalizer settings on a sound system, to boost or reduce certain frequency ranges.
