1. **"Data sent out of sequence"**: This is a crucial point. In packet switching, packets are not necessarily sent in the order they were created. They might take different routes through the network. The receiving device is responsible for reassembling them in the correct order.  
    
2. **"Small chunks (packets) of data at a time"**: The image shows numbered packets (1, 2, 3, 4) moving through the network. This highlights that data is divided into these smaller, manageable units.
    
3. **"Packets passed from node to node between source and destination"**: The network is represented by interconnected nodes (blue circles). Packets travel from one node to another until they reach their destination (from computer "A" to computer "X" in the diagram). The arrows illustrate the movement of packets.  
    
4. **"Used for terminal to computer and computer to computer communications"**: This indicates the primary applications of packet switching, including communication between individual computers and between computers and servers.

**How Packet Switching Work:**

- **Data Segmentation:** The sending computer "A" divides the data into packets (1, 2, 3, 4).
- **Routing:** Each node in the network determines the best path to forward a packet based on network conditions (e.g., congestion).  
- **Multiple Paths:** Packets might take different routes through the network, as seen by the various paths taken by the numbered packets.  
- **Reassembly:** The receiving computer "X" reassembles the packets in the correct order based on the sequence numbers embedded within the packets.  

**Advantages of Packet Switching:**

- **Efficiency:** Multiple users can share network resources efficiently.  
- **Robustness:** If one path is congested or fails, packets can be rerouted.  
- **Flexibility:** Supports various data types and applications.
- **Scalability:** Easily expandable to accommodate more users and traffic.
