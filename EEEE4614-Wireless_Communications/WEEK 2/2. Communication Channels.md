* **Twisted-wire pair:** This is the most common type of wire used in telephone lines and older Ethernet networks. It consists of two insulated wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference
* **Coaxial cable:** This cable has a central conductor surrounded by an insulator, a braided shield, and an outer jacket. It's used for cable television and high-frequency signal transmission. 
* **Waveguides:** These are hollow metallic tubes used to transmit microwave signals. They are typically used in high-frequency applications like radar and satellite communications.  
* **Optic fiber:** This uses thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit light signals. It offers very high bandwidth and is used for high-speed data communications over long distances.

* **Bandwidth** refers to the range of frequencies that a channel can transmit. The image provides approximate bandwidth values for each type of wireline channel:
    - **Twisted pair:** Several hundred kHz (kilohertz). This means it can transmit signals within a frequency range of a few hundred thousand cycles per second.
    - **Coaxial cable:** Several hundred MHz (megahertz). This indicates a much wider bandwidth, allowing for higher data rates.
    - **Waveguide:** Few GHz (gigahertz). This signifies even higher bandwidth, suitable for microwave frequencies.
    - **Optic fiber:** Very wide bandwidth. Optical fibers can transmit signals at extremely high frequencies, enabling data rates in the terabits per second range.

- **Amplitude distortion** refers to changes in the signal's strength, which can weaken or amplify the signal.  
- **Phase distortion** refers to changes in the signal's timing, which can alter the signal's shape and lead to errors.
