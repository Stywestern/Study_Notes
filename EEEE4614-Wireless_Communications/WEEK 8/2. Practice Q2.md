**Problem Setup:**
- **"I have a BW of 1MHz."** This sets the given bandwidth (BW) as 1 MHz.
- **"a big rate, like Rb = 25 Mbps?"** This is the question being asked: can a data rate (Rb) of 25 Mbps be achieved with the given bandwidth?
- **"(Yes, through by using symbols)"** This suggests that achieving a higher data rate might be possible by using a modulation scheme that transmits multiple bits per symbol.

**Solutions:**
1. **Maximum Symbol Rate (Rs_max):**
    - **"Max signal rate = Rs_max = 2 Msymbol/sec."** This calculates the maximum symbol rate using the formula:
    - **"Rmax = 2 * BW"** (This is a simplified version of the Nyquist formula, assuming an ideal scenario without roll-off factor).
    - **" = 2 * 1 = 2 Msymbol/sec (Maximum symbol rate)"** This shows the calculation: 2 * 1 MHz = 2 Msymbol/sec.
2. **Data Rate with QPSK:**
    - **"If I use QPSK -> 2 bits/symbol, Then Rb = 2 * 2 Msymbol/sec"** This calculates the data rate (Rb) when using QPSK modulation. QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) transmits 2 bits per symbol.
    - **" = 4 Mbit/sec"** This shows the calculation: 2 Msymbol/sec * 2 bits/symbol = 4 Mbit/sec.
    - **" = 4 Mbps"** (This is the same as 4 Mbit/sec).
