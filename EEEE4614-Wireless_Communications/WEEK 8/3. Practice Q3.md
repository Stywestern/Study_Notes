**The Problem:**
- **"If I have a 36 channel of 5 MHz, what is my maximum signal rate?"** This is the first part of the problem. We have 36 channels, each with a bandwidth of 5 MHz. We need to find the maximum symbol rate for a single channel.

Solution:
- **"a) (Answer: 10 Msymbol/sec) R = 2W = 2 x 5 = 10"** This shows the solution and the calculation. We use the Nyquist formula (R = 2W) to find the symbol rate (R) using the bandwidth (W).
- **"b) If I use 64 QAM, what is the maximum bitrate?"** This is the second part of the problem. We need to find the maximum data rate (bitrate) if we use 64-QAM modulation.
- **"2^6 = 64"** This indicates that 64-QAM transmits 6 bits per symbol (because 2^6 = 64).
- **"Rb_max = 10 x 6 = 60 Mbps"** This calculates the maximum bitrate by multiplying the symbol rate (10 Msymbol/sec) by the number of bits per symbol (6).
