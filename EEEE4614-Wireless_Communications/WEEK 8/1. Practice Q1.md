**The Problem:**
- **"If I want to transmit data at a rate of 1 Mbit/sec, what is the maximum bandwidth required?"** This is the core question. We're given a data rate (1 Mbit/sec) and need to find the bandwidth needed to transmit that data successfully.
- **"for QPSK, BPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM?"** This tells us we need to solve the problem for four different modulation schemes:
    - **QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)**
    - **BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)**
    - **16QAM (16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)**
    - **64QAM (64-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)**


**The Solution:**
- **a) QPSK:**
    - M = 4 (because QPSK has 4 signal levels)
    - Rs = R / log₂(M) = 1 Mbit/sec / log₂(4) = 1 Mbit/sec / 2 = 0.5 Msymbols/sec
    - BW = Rs / 2 = 0.5 Msymbols/sec / 2 = 0.25 MHz = 250 kHz
- **b) BPSK:**
    - M = 2 (because BPSK has 2 signal levels)
    - Rs = R / log₂(M) = 1 Mbit/sec / log₂(2) = 1 Mbit/sec / 1 = 1 Msymbol/sec
    - BW = Rs / 2 = 1 Msymbol/sec / 2 = 0.5 MHz = 500 kHz
- **c) 16QAM:**
    - M = 16 (because 16QAM has 16 signal levels)
    - Rs = R / log₂(M) = 1 Mbit/sec / log₂(16) = 1 Mbit/sec / 4 = 0.25 Msymbols/sec
    - BW = Rs / 2 = 0.25 Msymbols/sec / 2 = 0.125 MHz = 125 kHz
- **d) 64QAM:**
    - M = 64 (because 64QAM has 64 signal levels)
    - Rs = R / log₂(M) = 1 Mbit/sec / log₂(64) = 1 Mbit/sec / 6 = 1/6 Msymbols/sec
    - BW = Rs / 2 = (1/6) Msymbols/sec / 2 = 1/12 MHz
