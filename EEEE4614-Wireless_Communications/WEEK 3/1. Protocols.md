**1. What is a protocol architecture?**
- A protocol architecture, also known as a protocol stack or protocol suite, is a structured set of communication rules (protocols) that define how data is transmitted and received over a network.
- It organizes these protocols into layers, with each layer performing specific functions.
- This layered approach simplifies network design and implementation by breaking down complex communication tasks into smaller, more manageable units.
- Each layer interacts with the layers above and below it, providing services to the layer above and utilizing services from the layer below.

**2. How many layers are needed?**
- The number of layers in a protocol architecture depends on the specific network model.
- The most common models include:
    - **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model:** 7 layers
    - **TCP/IP model:** 4 or 5 layers (depending on interpretations)
- The key is to have enough layers to separate distinct functions but not so many that the architecture becomes overly complex.

**3. Major function of network access layer?**
- The network access layer (also known as the data link layer and physical layer combined in the TCP/IP model) is responsible for:
    - Controlling access to the physical transmission medium.
    - Handling the physical transmission of data between adjacent nodes.
    - Error detection and correction within the local network segment.
    - Addressing devices within the local network (e.g., MAC addresses).
    - It is the layer that interfaces with the network hardware.

**4. What is TCP/IP?**
- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the fundamental communication protocol suite used by the internet and most modern networks.
- It consists of a set of protocols that define how data is transmitted over the internet.
- It consists of 4 layers:
    - Application Layer
    - Transport Layer
    - Internet Layer
    - Network Access Layer

**5. What tasks performed by transport layer?**
- The transport layer is responsible for:
    - Providing reliable end-to-end data delivery.
    - Segmenting data into smaller units (segments) for transmission.
    - Reassembling segments into the original data at the destination.
    - Flow control to prevent congestion.
    - Error detection and correction (in TCP).
    - Multiplexing and demultiplexing applications.
    - It creates a logical connection between applications.

**6. Does all traffic running on Internet use TCP?**
- No, not all traffic uses TCP.
- While TCP is widely used for applications that require reliable data delivery (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfer), other protocols like UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are used for applications that prioritize speed and efficiency over reliability (e.g., streaming video, online gaming, VoIP).

**7. Differences between TCP & UDP?**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
    - Connection-oriented: Establishes a connection before data transmission.
    - Reliable: Guarantees data delivery through error detection and retransmission.
    - Ordered delivery: Ensures data arrives in the correct sequence.
    - Flow control: Manages data flow to prevent congestion.
    - Slower due to overhead.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
    - Connectionless: Does not establish a connection.
    - Unreliable: Does not guarantee data delivery.
    - Unordered delivery: Data may arrive out of sequence.
    - No flow control: Does not manage data flow.
    - Faster due to lower overhead.
    - UDP is good for applications where some data loss is acceptable, and speed is paramount.
