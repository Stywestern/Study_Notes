Developed by the US Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) for its packet switched network (ARPANET) 
	• Used by the global Internet 
	• No official model but a working one.
		– Application layer
		– Host to host or transport layer
		– Internet layer 
		– Network access layer 
		– Physical layer


Physical Layer 
	• Physical interface between data transmission device (e.g. computer) and transmission medium or network 
	• Characteristics of transmission medium 
	• Signal levels 
	• Data rates
	 • etc
	
Network Access Layer 
	• Exchange of data between end system and network • Destination address provision 
	• Invoking services like priority 

Internet Layer (IP) 
	• Systems may be attached to different networks
	• Routing functions across multiple networks 
	• Implemented in end systems and routers
	
Transport Layer (TCP) 
	• Reliable delivery of data 
	• Ordering of delivery  
	
Application Layer 
	• Support for user applications 
	• e.g. HTTP, SMPT


Trace of Simple Operation 
	• Process associated with port 1 in host A sends message to port 2 in host B 
	• Process at A hands down message to TCP to send to port 2 
	• TCP hands down to IP to send to host B 
	• IP hands down to network layer (e.g. Ethernet) to send to router J 
	• Generates a set of encapsulated PDUs

**1. The Four Layers of TCP/IP:**
The four layers of the TCP/IP model, though they aren't explicitly labelled. We can infer them from the protocol placement:
- **Application Layer (Top Row):** This layer contains protocols that directly interact with applications.
- **Transport Layer (Second Row):** Includes the core transport protocols, TCP and UDP.
- **Internet Layer (Third Row):** Primarily contains the Internet Protocol (IP) and related routing protocols.
- **Network Access Layer (Not Explicitly Shown):** This layer isn't shown in terms of protocols, but it's implied as the foundation upon which the other layers operate. It deals with the physical connections and data transmission over the local network.

**2. Protocols in Each Layer:**
- **Application Layer:**
    - **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):** Extends the format of email to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.  
    - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** A routing protocol used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems on the internet.
    - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
    - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The foundation of the World Wide Web, used for retrieving web pages and other resources.
    - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending email messages between mail servers.
    - **TELNET:** Allows a user to remotely access and control another computer.
    - **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** Used for managing and monitoring network devices.
    
- **Transport Layer:**
    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
    - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Provides connectionless, unreliable, and faster delivery of data.  
    
- **Internet Layer:**
    - **IP (Internet Protocol):** Responsible for addressing and routing packets across the internet.
    - **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for error reporting and network diagnostics.
    - **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):** Used for managing multicast group memberships.
    - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** An interior gateway routing protocol used within a single autonomous system.
    - **RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol):** Allows applications to reserve network resources for specific data flows.

**3. Key Takeaways:**
- **Layered Structure:** The image reinforces the layered approach of the TCP/IP model, showing how protocols are organized based on their functions.
- **Protocol Diversity:** It illustrates the wide range of protocols that make up the TCP/IP suite, each serving a specific purpose.
- **Interdependence:** The protocols work together to enable communication across the internet. For example, HTTP relies on TCP, which in turn relies on IP.
- **Core Protocols:** IP, TCP, and UDP are the core protocols that form the foundation of the internet.
