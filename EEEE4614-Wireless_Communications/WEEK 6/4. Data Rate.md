- **Factors to Increase Data Rate:**
    - **"1) More BW."** More bandwidth (BW) directly translates to a higher potential data rate, as seen in the formulas.
    - **"2) More received power. (SNR will be higher)"** Higher received power increases the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which, according to the Shannon-Hartley theorem, allows for a higher data rate.
    - **"3) If it's a wireless channel, effect of MIMO."** Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology in wireless communication can significantly increase data rate.
    - **"And MIMO comes as a multiplicative effect."** MIMO provides a multiplicative increase in data rate, meaning it can boost the rate by a factor greater than the number of antennas.
    
- **Data Rate in Noiseless Channel:**
    - **"When there is no noise, you can increase the data rate with many communication. As long as you select higher order modulation you get bigger data rate."** This emphasizes the importance of modulation in noiseless channels.
    - **"R[sym/sec] = 2W"** This is the Nyquist formula for the maximum symbol rate in a noiseless channel.
    - **"R[bits/sec] = 2W log<sub>2</sub> M (This is unbounded)."** This shows that in a noiseless channel, the data rate can be increased indefinitely by increasing the number of modulation levels (M).
    
- **Data Rate in Noisy Channel (Shannon-Hartley Theorem):**
    - **"However when there is noise affecting your signal in the channel, Shannon calculated the max. data rate as:"** This introduces the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which accounts for noise.
    - **"C = BW log<sub>2</sub> (1 + SNR)"** This is the Shannon-Hartley capacity formula, giving the maximum achievable data rate (C) in a noisy channel.
    - **"BW of channel"** This reminds us that bandwidth is a limiting factor.
    - **"# of antennas"** This suggests that in MIMO systems, the number of antennas can influence the capacity.

- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):**
    - **"SNR = Signal Power / Noise Power = S / N = S / (N<sub>o</sub> * BW)"** This defines the SNR and shows its relationship to signal power (S), noise power (N), noise power spectral density (N<sub>o</sub>), and bandwidth (BW).
    - **"If n = 1, C = BW log<sub>2</sub> (1 + SNR)"** This is a specific case of the Shannon-Hartley formula.
    - **"N<sub>o</sub> = Noise power density"**
    - **"BW = Bandwidth"**
    - **"T = Temperature in Kelvin"** (This is likely referring to the noise temperature used in some noise calculations.)
    
- **Bit Rate and Bit Duration:**
    - **"R = 1 / T<sub>b</sub>"** This shows the relationship between data rate (R) and bit duration (T<sub>b</sub>).
    - **Bit duration** is the **period of time that defines one bit** in a digital signal
