- **Nyquist Bandwidth:**
    - **"In order to do a reliable transmission in a channel, without intersymbol interference, the bandwidth of the channel should be at least half the data rate, where data rate is in symbols/sec."** This is the core idea of the Nyquist theorem.
    - **Intersymbol Interference (ISI):** ISI occurs when symbols in a digital transmission overlap and interfere with each other, leading to errors.
    - **Nyquist Bandwidth = R / 2** (where R is the data rate in symbols/sec). This formula expresses the minimum bandwidth required to avoid ISI.
    - **"Otherwise intersymbol interference will arise."** This emphasizes the importance of meeting the Nyquist criterion.
    - **"This is the case when there is no noise in the channel."** The Nyquist theorem assumes an ideal, noiseless channel.
    
- **Data Rate:**
	- $R_s = R_b / log_2(M)$ where Rb is the bitrate and M is the modulation. Modulation is something like taking 2 or 8 or 16 bits and packaging them to symbols.
    - **R<sub>max</sub> = η * W * log<sub>2</sub> M** This is a more general formula for the maximum data rate, considering:
        - **η (eta): Spectral Efficiency:** A measure of how efficiently the bandwidth is used.
        - **W:** Bandwidth of the channel.
        - **M:** Number of signal levels or symbols (related to the modulation scheme).
    - **Base-band Transmission:**
        - **R<sub>s</sub> = 2W / (1 + α)** (where α is the roll-off factor, related to pulse shaping).
        - **η = 2 / (1 + α)**
        - **R<sub>max</sub> = 2W / (1 + α) * log<sub>2</sub> M**
        - **"Raised cosine pulses"** are often used in base-band to minimize ISI.
    - **Band-pass Transmission:**
        - **R<sub>s</sub> = W / (1 + α)**
        - **η = 1 / (1 + α)**
        - **R<sub>max</sub> = W / (1 + α) * log<sub>2</sub> M**
        
	- **Noise-Free Channel:**
	    - **C = 2B log<sub>2</sub> M** This is another form of the Nyquist formula, where:
	        - **C:** Channel capacity (maximum data rate).
	        - **B:** Bandwidth.
	        - **M:** Number of signal levels.
	    - **"Modulation index"** refers to the number of signal levels (M).
	    
	- **Noisy Channel:**
	    - **C = B log<sub>2</sub> (1 + SNR)** This is the **Shannon-Hartley Theorem**, which gives the channel capacity in the presence of noise:
		    - **SNR:** Signal-to-noise ratio.
        
- **Modulation:**
    - **4-PSK:** A modulation scheme with 4 phase shifts (M=4).
    - **8-PSK:** A modulation scheme with 8 phase shifts (M=8).
    - **"M=8 get smaller for higher-order modulation techniques"**
