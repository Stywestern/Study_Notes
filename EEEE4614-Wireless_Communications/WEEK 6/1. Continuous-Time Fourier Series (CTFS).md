**Periodic Signal**, A periodic signal repeats itself over time. We denote the period as "To".

**Synthesis (Reconstruction):**
- **Complex Exponential Form:**
    - The main equation is: **x̂(t) = Σ (from k = -∞ to ∞) a<sub>k</sub> e<sup>j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup>**
    - Let's break it down:
        - **x̂(t)** represents the reconstructed periodic signal (an approximation of the original signal x(t)).
        - **Σ (from k = -∞ to ∞)** means we're summing an infinite number of terms.
        - **a<sub>k</sub>** are the Fourier Series coefficients. They represent the "weights" or amplitudes of each frequency component.
        - **e<sup>j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup>** are complex exponentials, which form the basis functions of the Fourier Series. They represent sinusoidal waves at different frequencies.
        - **ω<sub>o</sub>** is the fundamental frequency, calculated as **ω<sub>o</sub> = 2π / T<sub>o</sub>**, where T<sub>o</sub> is the period of the signal.
        - **k** is an integer index that determines the frequency of each component (kω<sub>o</sub>).
- **Trigonometric Form:**
	- **x̂(t) = a<sub>o</sub> + 2 Σ (from k = 1 to ∞) A<sub>k</sub> cos(k ω<sub>o</sub> t + φ<sub>k</sub>)**
	- This form expresses the signal as a sum of cosine waves with different amplitudes (A<sub>k</sub>) and phase shifts (φ<sub>k</sub>).
	- It can also be written in terms of sine and cosine components: **x̂(t) = a<sub>o</sub> + 2 Σ (from k = 1 to ∞) [B<sub>k</sub> cos(k ω<sub>o</sub> t) - C<sub>k</sub> sin(k ω<sub>o</sub> t)]**

- **Analysis (Finding Coefficients):**
    - The formula for calculating the Fourier Series coefficients **a<sub>k</sub>** is: **a<sub>k</sub> = (1/T<sub>o</sub>) ∫ (from -T<sub>o</sub>/2 to T<sub>o</sub>/2) x(t) e<sup>-j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup> dt**
        - This integral calculates the projection of the signal x(t) onto each complex exponential basis function.
- **Relationship between Forms:**
    - The complex exponential coefficients (a<sub>k</sub>) are related to the trigonometric coefficients (A<sub>k</sub>, φ<sub>k</sub>, B<sub>k</sub>, C<sub>k</sub>) by:
        - **a<sub>k</sub> = A<sub>k</sub> e<sup>j φ<sub>k</sub></sup>** (polar form)
        - **a<sub>k</sub> = B<sub>k</sub> + j C<sub>k</sub>** (rectangular form)
- **Euler's Formula:**
    - Euler's formula: **e<sup>j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup> = cos(k ω<sub>o</sub> t) + j sin(k ω<sub>o</sub> t)**, which connects complex exponentials to sines and cosines.


- **Energy of the Periodic Signal:**
    - **"Energy of the periodic signal should be finite, in one period."**
    - Mathematically, this is expressed as: **∫ |x̂(t)|² dt < ∞ (integrated over one period To)**.
        - **|x̂(t)|²** represents the instantaneous power of the signal.
        - **∫ |x̂(t)|² dt** represents the total energy of the signal over one period.
        - **< ∞** means the energy is finite (not infinite).
    - **Square Integrable:** The text also says **"x̂(t) square integrable"**, which is another way of saying the same thing: the integral of the squared magnitude of the signal is finite.
    
- **Dirichlet Conditions:**
    - These are a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the Fourier Series.
    - The text states: **∫ |x(t)| dt < ∞ (integrated over one period To)**.
        - This means the integral of the absolute value of the signal over one period must be finite.
    - **"and x(t) 'well-behaved' (finite # of maxima, minima and discontinuities)"**. This means the signal must not have an infinite number of peaks, valleys, or jumps within a finite interval.
    
- **Periodicity of Fourier Representation:**
    - The note at the bottom explains: **"Note that, the Fourier representation of a periodic signal is always periodic. Because the complex exponential e<sup>j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup> will repeat after 2π, and will change only between 0-2π interval."**
    - Let's break this down:
        - **e<sup>j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup>** is the complex exponential term in the Fourier Series.
        - **ω<sub>o</sub> = 2π / T<sub>o</sub>**, where T<sub>o</sub> is the period of the signal.
        - Therefore, **e<sup>j k ω<sub>o</sub> t</sup> = e<sup>j k (2π / T<sub>o</sub>) t</sup>**.
        - When **t** increases by **T<sub>o</sub>**, the exponent **j k (2π / T<sub>o</sub>) t** increases by **j k 2π**, which corresponds to a full rotation in the complex plane.
        - Since **e<sup>j 2πn</sup> = 1** for any integer **n**, the complex exponential repeats itself after **T<sub>o</sub>**, making the Fourier Series representation periodic with the same period as the original signal.
