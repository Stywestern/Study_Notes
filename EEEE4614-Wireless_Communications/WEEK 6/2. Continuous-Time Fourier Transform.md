- **Fourier Transform (Analysis):**
    - The equation given is: **X(ω) = ∫ (from -∞ to ∞) x(t) e<sup>-jωt</sup> dt**
        - **X(ω)** represents the Fourier Transform of the signal x(t). It's a function of frequency (ω).
        - **x(t)** is the original time-domain signal.
        - **e<sup>-jωt</sup>** is a complex exponential, used to decompose the signal into its frequency components.
        - **∫ (from -∞ to ∞)** means we're integrating over all time.
        
- **Inverse Fourier Transform (Synthesis):**
    - The equation given is: **x(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫ (from -∞ to ∞) X(ω) e<sup>jωt</sup> dω**
        - **x(t)** is the original time-domain signal, reconstructed from its Fourier Transform.
        - **X(ω)** is the Fourier Transform of the signal.
        - **e<sup>jωt</sup>** is again a complex exponential, used to synthesize the signal from its frequency components.
        - **∫ (from -∞ to ∞)** means we're integrating over all frequencies.
        
- **Relationship between Fourier Series and Fourier Transform:**
    - **"The periodic signal has Fourier series representation. The coefficients in this series are the samples of the Fourier Transform of the non-periodic signal, which is the envelope function."**
    - Let's unpack this:
        - **Periodic Signals:** As we saw earlier, periodic signals are represented by the Fourier Series, which decomposes them into a sum of discrete frequency components.
        - **Aperiodic Signals:** Non-periodic signals are represented by the Fourier Transform, which decomposes them into a continuous spectrum of frequencies.
        - **Sampling:** The Fourier Series coefficients (a<sub>k</sub>) are essentially samples of the Fourier Transform (X(ω)) of a single period of the periodic signal.
        - **Envelope Function:** The Fourier Transform (X(ω)) acts as an "envelope" that outlines the shape of the Fourier Series coefficients.
        
- **Graphical Representation:**
    - The image shows a time-domain signal x(t) (a square wave) and its corresponding Fourier Transform X(ω).
    - **x(t)** is a periodic square wave.
    - **X(ω)** is a sinc (sinx/x) function, which is the Fourier Transform of a rectangular pulse.
    - The Fourier Series coefficients (a<sub>k</sub>) are represented as vertical lines (samples) under the X(ω) curve.
    - The spacing between these samples is determined by the fundamental frequency (ω<sub>o</sub> = 2π / T<sub>o</sub>), which is inversely proportional to the period (T<sub>o</sub>) of the signal.
