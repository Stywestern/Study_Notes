Most of the harm is caused by "accidents" which are unwanted events resulting from the wanted processes. 
Classification of Accidents
- Procedural Accidents: They result from a deviation of desired procedures, for example when a pilot doesn't switch a control device they should have switched before departure. These are mostly caused by humans.  
- Engineering Accidents: They are caused by flawed design of products or incorrect materials being used in their realization, for example using different metal for a prefect design of a plane.
- Systemic Accidents: These type or errors are caused by an unaccounted or unintended environmental conditions being applied to the products or systems, for example a perfect car that was designed for winter can break in a desert environment.

To maximize the safety of a system:
1. Comply with the law
2. Conform to the current standard of the profession
3. Consider alternative designs
4. Foresee potential misuse of the product
5. Test the product
