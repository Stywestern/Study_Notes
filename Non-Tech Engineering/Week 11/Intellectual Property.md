	•Copyright covers literary works (such as novels, poems and plays), films, music, artistic works (e.g., drawings, paintings, photographs and sculptures) and architectural design.

''Trademark'' means trademarks or service marks including guaranteemarks and collectivemarks.
A trademark is a sign that serves the purpose of distinguishing the goods produced and/or traded by an undertaking from the goods of other undertakings.

A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention –a product or process that provides a new way of doing something, or that offers a new technical solution to a problem.
A patent provides patent owners with protection for their inventions. Protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years.

Copyright is a legal concept, enacted by most governments, giving the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time.
