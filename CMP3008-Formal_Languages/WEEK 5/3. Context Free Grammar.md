A CFG is a 4 tuple (V, $\Sigma$, R, S)
- A CFG consists of:
    - A set of **variables** (or non-terminal symbols): These are symbols that represent syntactic categories or placeholders. They are usually represented by uppercase letters. V, set of symbols
    - A set of **terminal symbols:** These are the actual symbols that make up the strings in the language. They are usually represented by lowercase letters or symbols. $\Sigma$, set of symbols
    - A set of **production rules:** These rules define how variables can be replaced by other variables or terminals. They have the form: R, set of relations
        - Variable → String of variables and/or terminals
    - A **start variable:** This is a special variable that represents the root of the grammar. S, symbol

**How CFGs Generate Strings:**
- To generate a string, you start with the start variable.
- You repeatedly apply production rules, replacing variables with the strings on the right-hand side of the rules.
- You continue until you have a string that consists only of terminal symbols.0

### Example 
• Context free grammar G1: 
• 3 Substitution rules (productions) 
• A → 0A1 
• A → B 
• B → # 
• Variables = {A, B} 
• Terminals = {0, 1, #} 
• Start variable = A

For example, grammar G1 generates the string 000#111. 
• The sequence of substitutions to obtain a string is called a derivation. 
A derivation of string 000#111 in grammar G1 is • A ⇒0A1 ⇒00A11 ⇒000A111 ⇒ 000B111 ⇒ 000#111

### Parse Trees 
• Each CFG can be represented using a parse tree: 
	• Each internal node 
	• Each leaf is labeled by a variable in V is terminal symbol 
	• For a production, A==>X1X2…Xk, then any internal node labeled A has k children which are labeled from X1,X2,…Xk from left to right

All strings generated in this way constitute the language of the grammar. 
We write L(G1) for the language of grammar G1. 
• Some experimentation with the grammar G1 shows us that L(G1) is: 
A → 0A1 A → B B → # 
{0n#1n| n ≥ 0}

Note: A notation for variable transitions, 
A → 0A1 and A → B into a single line A → 0A1 | B,
that symbol is called "or" (it is like that in C as well).

A general grammar:

Let's go from bottom to top:
- From PREP to ARTICLE these are "terminals"
- CMPLX-VERB variable can be: touches OR touches NOUN-PHRASE
- CMPLX-NOUN can be: the boy
- PREP-PHRASE can be: with the boy
- VERB-PHRASE can be: touches OR touches NOUN-PHRASE OORR touches with the boy OR touches with the boy NOUN-PHRASE
- NOUN-PHRASE can be: the boy OR the boy with the boy
- Thus, the SENTENCE is can be: the boy touches OR the boy touches the boy OR the boy touches with the boy ...
- For example a sentence with these words: "The boy with a girl" "touches the flower".
