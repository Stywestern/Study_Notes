• A language class larger than the class of regular languages 
• Supports natural, recursive notation called “context-free grammar” 
• Applications: 
	• Parse trees, compilers 
	• XML

Context Free Grammar
### An Example 
• A palindrome is a word that reads identical from both ends 
	• E.g., madam, redivider, malayalam, 010010010 
• Let L = { w | w is a binary palindrome} 
• Is L regular? 
• No. 
• Proof: 
• Let w=0p10p 
• By Pumping lemma, w can be rewritten as xyz, such that xyiz is also L (for any i≥0) 
• But |xy|≤p and y≠$\epsilon$  
• ==> y=0+ 
• ==> xyiz will NOT be in L for i=0 
• ==> Contradiction 

But the language of palindromes is a CFL , because it supports recursive substitution (in the form of a CFG) 
• This is because we can construct a “grammar" like this: 
1. A ==> $\epsilon$
2. A ==> 0 
3. A ==> 1 
4. A ==> 0A0 
5. A ==> 1A1
