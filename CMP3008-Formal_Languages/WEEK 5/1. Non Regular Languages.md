Not all languages are regular. But there may still exist Automatas that can recognize them.

The language B = {0^n1^n| n ≥ 0} is nonregular because the number of 0s isn’t limited, the machine will have to keep track of an unlimited number of possibilities. But it cannot do so with any finite number of states.

### Pumping Lemma 
• Pumping lemma theorem states that all regular languages have a special property. 
• If we can show that a language does not have this property, we are guaranteed that it is not regular. 
• So, we can use proof by contradiction! 
• The property states that all strings in the language can be “pumped” if they are at least as long as a certain special value, called the pumping length. 
• That means each such string contains a section that can be repeated any number of times with the resulting string remaining in the language

Formally:
If A is a regular language, then there is a number p (pumping length) where if s is any string in A of a length at least p, then s may be divided into three pieces, s=xyz, satisfaying:
- for each i>= 0, x$y^i$z $\in$ A
- |y| > 0
-  |xy| <= p

It says that basically:

To use the pumping lemma to prove that a language B is not regular, 
	• First assume that B is regular in order to obtain a contradiction. 
	• Then use the pumping lemma to guarantee the existence of a pumping length p such that all strings of length p or greater in B can be pumped. 
	• Next, find a string s in B that has length p or greater but that cannot be pumped. 
	• Finally, demonstrate that s cannot be pumped by considering all ways of dividing s into x, y, and z (taking condition 3 of the pumping lemma into account if convenient) and, for each such division, finding a value i where $xy^iz$ is not a member of B.

e.g.
• C= {w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1s} 
• Assume C is regular 
• Let s be the string $0^p1^p$. 
• With s being a member of C and having length more than p, the pumping lemma guarantees that s can be split into three pieces, s = xyz, where for any i ≥ 0 the string xyiz is in C

• If we let x and z be the empty string and y be the string 0p1p, then xyiz always has an equal number of 0s and 1s and hence is in C. So it seems that s can be pumped. 
• But! Here condition 3 in the pumping lemma is useful. 
• It stipulates that when pumping s, it must be divided so that |xy| ≤ p. 
• If |xy| ≤ p, then y must consist only of 0s, so xyyz is not in C. (further exp:)
	- The pumping lemma's condition |xy| ≤ p is the key. It means the length of the substring formed by concatenating x and y must be less than or equal to the pumping length 'p'.
    - If you set y to the entire string, 0<sup>p</sup>1<sup>p</sup>, then the length of |xy| is 2p. this violates the |xy| <= p rule.
    - Therefore, you cannot set y to the entire string.
• Therefore, s cannot be pumped. That gives us the desired contradiction

NOTE: A string can pass the Lemma test, doesn't mean that the language is now regular. You need only to find ONE string that doesn't pass, then you are golden.
• Show the same for s = (01)p which is also a member of C? 
• Can we pump it? (Yes we would be able to)
• x = ε, y = 01, and z = (01)p−1. Then xyiz ∈ C for every value of i.

NOTE: Not only you should be able to pump more y, you should also be able to get rid of it
•E = {0i1j| i > j} 
• s = 0p+11p 
• 0000 0 011111 (if p is 5) 
• When y = 0 or y = (0)p , removing y (xy0z) will reduce the number of zeros and hence, the resulting string will not be in E, so we have a contradiction
