• Next move of a pushdown automata is determined by:
- The current state, 
- Next input symbol read, 
- Top symbol of the stack 
Either symbol may be ε, causing the machine to move without reading a symbol from the input or without reading a symbol from the stack.

Example below presents a sample transition rule: δ(q1, a, b) = {(q2, cd), (q3, $\lambda$)} 
• According to this rule, when the control unit is in state q1, the input symbol is a, and the top of the stack is b, two moves are possible: 
	• New state is q2 and the symbols cd replace b on the stack 
	• New state is q3 and b is simply removed from the stack 
• If a particular transition is not defined, the corresponding (state, symbol, stack top) configuration represents a _dead_ state

• Example: Consider the npda 
Q={q0,q1,q2,q3}, 
Σ = { a, b }, 
$\Gamma$ = { 0, 1 }, 
z = 0, 
F = {q3} 
with initial state q0 and transition function given by: 
δ(q0, a, 0) = {(q1, 10), (q3, $\lambda$) } 
δ(q0, $\lambda$, 0) = { (q3, $\lambda$) } 
δ(q1, a, 1) = { (q1, 11) } 
δ(q1, b, 1) = { (q2, $\lambda$) }
δ(q2, b, 1) = { (q2, $\lambda$) }
δ(q2, $\lambda$, 0) = { (q3, $\lambda$) } 
• As long as the control unit is in q1, a 1 is pushed onto the stack when an a is read 
• The first b causes control to shift to q2, which removes a symbol from the stack whenever a b is read.

• We write “a, b → c” to signify that when the machine is reading an a from the input, it may replace the symbol b on the top of the stack with a c. 
• Any of a, b, and c may be ε. 
• If a is ε, the machine may make this transition without reading any symbol from the input. 
• If b is ε, the machine may make this transition without reading and popping any symbol from the stack. 
• If c is ε, the machine does not write any symbol on the stack when going along this transition
