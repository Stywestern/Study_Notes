Normally there is way it can be done, definition wise at least, but there is a trick. The machine initially puts a special symbol $, and if it ever goes to a point where it reads $, it understands the stack is now empty.

It works by initially adding $, then it counts 0s and adds 0s to its stack. Then it counts 1s and removes 0s from the stack. If when the 1s are spent, it also sees the $, we accept the string. Otherwise it is stuck on a dead state and not accepted.
