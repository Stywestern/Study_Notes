• Pushdown automata may be nondeterministic. 
• Deterministic and nondeterministic pushdown automata are not equivalent in power. 
• Nondeterministic pushdown automata recognize certain languages that no deterministic pushdown automata can recognize. 
• Recall that deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata do recognize the same class of languages, so the pushdown automata situation is different. 
• We focus on nondeterministic pushdown automata because these automata are equivalent in power to context-free grammars.
