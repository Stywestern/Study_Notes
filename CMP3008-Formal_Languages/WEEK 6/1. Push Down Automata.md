PDAs are like NFAs but they also have an extra component called "stack". This component provides additional memory beyond the finite states. This stack allows PDAs to recognize nonregular languages.

Adding a symbol to this stack is referred to as "pushing", while reading and removing an element is called "popping". If you remember the stack data structure the concept will be familiar to you.

#### Recognizing {0^n1^n where n>0}
• A stack is valuable because it can hold an unlimited amount of information. 
• Recall that a finite automaton is unable to recognize the language {0n1n | n ≥ 0} because it cannot store very large numbers in its finite memory. 
• A PDA is able to recognize this language because it can use its stack to store the number of 0s it has seen. 
• Thus, the unlimited nature of a stack allows the PDA to store numbers of unbounded size.

How:
* Read symbols from the input. 
* As each 0 is read, push it onto the stack. 
* As soon as 1s are seen, pop a 0 off the stack for each 1 read. 
* If reading the input is finished exactly when the stack becomes empty of 0s, accept the input. 
* If the stack becomes empty while 1s remain or if the 1s are finished while the stack still contains 0s or if any 0s appear in the input following 1s, reject the input.
