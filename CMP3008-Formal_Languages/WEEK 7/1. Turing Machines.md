Turing machines are very powerful abstract systems that could simulate any problem.
Today's general computers are a practical example of Turing machines, they can _theoretically_ do anything.

If a problem can not be solved using a Turing machine, that problem is "undecidable".

### Standart Turing Machine
• A standard Turing machine has unlimited storage in the form of a tape consisting of an infinite number of cells, with each cell storing one symbol 
• The read-write head can travel in both directions, processing one symbol per move 
• A deterministic control function causes the machine to change states and possibly overwrite the tape contents 
• Input string is surrounded by blanks, so the input alphabet is considered a proper subset of the tape alphabet

• Initially the tape contains only the input string and is blank everywhere else. 
• If the machine needs to store information, it may write this information on the tape. 
• To read the information that it has written, the machine can move its head back over it. 
• The machine continues computing until it decides to produce an output. 
• The outputs accept and reject are obtained by entering designated accepting and rejecting states. 
• If it doesn’t enter an accepting or a rejecting state, it will go on forever, never halting.
