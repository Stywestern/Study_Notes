• As a Turing machine computes, changes occur in the current state, the current tape contents, and the current head location. 
• A setting of these three items is called a configuration of the Turing machine. 
• Configurations often are represented in a special way. 
	• For a state q and two strings u and v over the tape alphabet Γ, we write uqv for the configuration where the current state is q, the current tape contents is uv, and the current head location is the first symbol of v. 
	• The tape contains only blanks following the last symbol of v.
