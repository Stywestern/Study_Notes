Computability Theory:
- Solvable/computable problems
- Unsolvable/incomputable problems

Complexity Theory:
- Easy problems
- Hard problems

Automata Theory:
- Defines the stuff that does the computing precisely

Automaton: An abstract computing device, it accepts inputs and produces some output. It may possess a temporary storage and may make decisions (like you).

Formal Language: Set of sentences formed by set of symbols according to formal and unbreakable rules (like mathematics) 

Grammar: A set of rules that defines how a sentence is constructed by a specific formal language (like the rules for order of operations in math)
