An embedded system is an application that contains at least one programmable computer (like a microprocessor).

Embedded systems are designs that do a specific task, instead of systems like general computers who can do (theoretically) everything.

Characteristics:
- Single functioned
- Tightly constrained
- Reactive and real time
- Microprocessors based
- Memory
- Connected to main frame
- HW-SW systems

Microprocessors only understand machine code (lowest level language). 
They have limited memory, code should be efficient.
They need to have low-level access to the hardware.
