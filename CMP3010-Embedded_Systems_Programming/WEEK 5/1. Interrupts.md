An interrupt allows a program mounted on a chip to immediately respond to an inside or outside event -such as an analog or digital signal- without having to wait for the loop() function to finish it's cycle.
When a program is interrupted, it executes the process it was coded when a specified type of interrupt happens, and then continues the loop() from where it was before.

Interrupt protocols reside in the DDRD, lowest address has the higher importance
- RESET has the highest priority, then INT0 etc.

Pins to control interrupts:
- INT0 - PORTD[2]
- INT1 - PORTD[3]
- PCINT[23:0] - any signal change 
- PCINT[7:0] - PORTB [7:0]
- PCINT[14:8] - PORTC [6:0]
- PCINT[23:16] - PORTD [7:0]

### How to Setup External Interrupt?
There is a function that automatically sets the registries:
- attachInterrupt(interrupt, function, mode)
	- interrupt is either 0 or 1
	- function is the process to be called
	- mode can be LOW, CHANGE, RISING, FALLING
- to revert just use detachInterrupt(interrupt)

You can also manually set it using ISR Macro:
	ISR(EXT_INT0_vect){	
	}
	 EIMSK = B00000001
	 EICRA = B00000011

What is happening here is that:

**1. ISR Macro to Handle Interrupt**
- **ISR(EXT_INT0_vect)**
    - This line defines an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) using the `ISR` macro. In AVR microcontrollers, interrupts are events that cause the microcontroller to pause its current execution and jump to a specific function (the ISR) to handle the event.
    - `EXT_INT0_vect` is the interrupt vector name associated with External Interrupt 0. This indicates that this specific ISR will be executed when an interrupt occurs on the external interrupt pin INT0.
    - The empty curly braces `{}` indicate that there is currently no code within the ISR. In a real application, you would place the code needed to handle the interrupt event inside these braces.
**2. Setting Registers Directly**
- **EIMSK = B00000001**
    - `EIMSK` stands for External Interrupt Mask Register. This register is used to enable or disable external interrupts.
    - `B00000001` is a binary representation of the value being assigned to the register. In this case, only the least significant bit (bit 0) is set to 1. This means that only External Interrupt 0 (INT0) is enabled. Other external interrupts (if available) are disabled.
- **EICRA = B00000011**
    - `EICRA` stands for External Interrupt Control Register A. This register is used to configure the trigger conditions for the external interrupts.
    - `B00000011` is a binary representation indicating that the two least significant bits are set to 1. These bits control the trigger for INT0. The specific meaning of `0b11` depends on the microcontroller architecture but often corresponds to a rising edge or a logic level change trigger.
