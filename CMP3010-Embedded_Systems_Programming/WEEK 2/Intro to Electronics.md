Current, denoted I, is the movement of electrons, more specifically it is the number of electrons travelling in second. Measured in A (Ampere), 1A means 6.241 $\times$ $10^{18}$. 
Currents have amplitudes and directions. As the electrons are negatively charge, a group of electrons moving to the right will generate a current to the left.

Voltage, denoted V, is the electrical potential difference between two points. Measured in V (volts), and the measure is always as a difference (like heat). 
Voltage is the electromotive force that create currents, the current will flow from high voltage to low voltage. 

The currents flow in a medium, which is called a Resistor (this could be copper wire). The resistors will cause the loss of energy thorough friction, the amount of which is proportional to the resistance, measured in ohms ($\ohm$).

Ohm's Law, the relation between these concepts:
V = I $\times$ R

Power, denoted P, is somewhat like the energy in an electronic system. It is measured in W (Watts). It has neither a direction nor a polarity.
P = V $\times$ I

Circuits, they have a battery that creates voltage and thus current, which is propagated thorough resistors:
