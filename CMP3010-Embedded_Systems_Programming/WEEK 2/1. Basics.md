The information for processors are stored in a 2 based counting systems called "binary" like (001001110). In this notation 0s represent little to no current and 1s represent detectable current.

All steps of these numbers are called "bits", (1001 is a 4 bit number) and 4 bits make a byte. Processors generally store and operate on collection of bytes, but they are generally named for the number of bits (like intel64, which stores and operates on 64 bits -8bytes-)

Precision, is the number of distinct or different values. They can be represented in decimal digits, bytes or binary bits.
Alternatives are the total number of possible values, like 256 for an 8-bit system.
An 8-bit DAG (digital to analog converter) can generate 256 analog outputs, and for ADC (analog to digital converter) the vice-versa.
