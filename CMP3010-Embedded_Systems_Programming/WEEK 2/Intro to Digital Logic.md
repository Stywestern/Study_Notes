A bit can be one (there is voltage) or 0 (there is no voltage).

Generally, a voltage 0-1.3V is considered low and 2-5V is considered high. The 0.7V nomansland is used to mitigate fluctuations. If the previous voltage was 2.3 and now it is 1.7, both times we say the bit is 1, and if it was 1.2 and now it is 1.7 we say it was 0.
