### 1. Behaviorism

**Key Concepts:**

- **Focus on Observable Behavior:** Behaviorism emphasizes observable behaviors rather than internal thoughts or feelings. Learning is viewed as a change in behavior resulting from experience.
- **Reinforcement and Punishment:** Behaviorists believe that behavior is influenced by rewards (reinforcements) or punishments. Positive reinforcement increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated, while punishment decreases it.
- **Stimulus-Response Theory:** Learning occurs through interactions with the environment, where a stimulus provokes a response.

**Key Theorists:**

- **B.F. Skinner:** Developed the concept of operant conditioning, where behavior is shaped by consequences.
- **John B. Watson:** Focused on the idea that psychology should be based on observable behaviors.

**Applications:**

- Often used in education through practices like drills, repetition, and reinforcement systems, such as rewards for correct answers.

### 2. Cognitivism

**Key Concepts:**

- **Focus on Mental Processes:** Cognitivism emphasizes the role of mental processes in understanding how people learn. It looks at how information is processed, stored, and retrieved.
- **Information Processing:** Learning is viewed as an active process of acquiring and organizing information. The mind is likened to a computer that processes incoming information.
- **Constructivism:** A branch of cognitivism that suggests learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiences and reflecting on those experiences.

**Key Theorists:**

- **Jean Piaget:** Known for his theory of cognitive development, which outlines how children develop logical thinking through stages.
- **Lev Vygotsky:** Emphasized the social context of learning and introduced the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), where learners can achieve higher levels of understanding with guidance.

**Applications:**

- Used in educational strategies that focus on understanding, critical thinking, and problem-solving, often involving collaborative learning and scaffolding.

### 3. Connectivism

**Key Concepts:**

- **Networked Learning:** Connectivism posits that learning occurs across a network of diverse connections, including people, organizations, and technology.
- **Knowledge is Distributed:** Knowledge is not only held by individuals but is distributed across networks, emphasizing the importance of relationships and connectivity.
- **Continuous Learning:** Emphasizes the need for individuals to constantly seek new information and adapt to a rapidly changing environment.

**Key Theorists:**

- **George Siemens:** Introduced connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age, highlighting the impact of technology on learning.
- **Stephen Downes:** Collaborated with Siemens in developing the theory, focusing on online learning networks.

**Applications:**

- Common in online learning environments, social media, and communities of practice where learners share resources and knowledge, facilitating collaborative learning.

### Summary

- **Behaviorism** focuses on observable behaviors and external reinforcements.
- **Cognitivism** centers on internal mental processes and the organization of knowledge.
- **Connectivism** emphasizes the importance of social connections and technology in learning.
