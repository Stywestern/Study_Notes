Six principles of adult learning:
	Adults are internally motivated and self-directed 
	Adults bring life experiences and knowledge to learning experiences 
	Adults are goal oriented 
	Adults are relevancy oriented 
	Adults are practical 
	Adult learners like to be respected

Adults need to know why they are learning something -> Effective teachers explain their reasons for teaching specific skills.
Adults learn by doing -> Effective instruction focuses on tasks that adults can perform, rather than on memorization of content.
Adults are problem-solvers and learn best -> When the subject is of immediate use, effective instruction involves the learner in solving real-life problems.

Gagné identifies five major categories of learning: 
●verbal information,
●intellectual skills, 
●cognitive strategies, 
●motor skills
●attitudes. 
Different internal and external conditions are necessary for each type of learning.
For example, for cognitive strategies to be learned -> a chance to practice developing new solutions to problems; 
For learn attitudes -> exposure to a credible role model or persuasive arguments.

Nine instructional events and corresponding cognitive processes:
1.Gaining attention (reception)
2.Informing learners of the objective (expectancy)
3.Stimulating recall of prior learning (retrieval)
4.Presenting the stimulus (selective perception)
5.Providing learning guidance (semantic encoding)
6.Eliciting performance (responding)
7.Providing feedback (reinforcement)
8.Assessing performance (retrieval)
9.Enhancing retention and transfer (generalization)
